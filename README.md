# G2Net Gravitational Wave Detection

## Introduction
This project aims to detect gravitational waves using the G2Net dataset from Kaggle. We utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the waveforms. This notebook includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- **Introduction**: Overview of the project and objectives.
- **Imports and Setup**: Import necessary libraries and set up configurations.
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize waveform data and split it into training and validation sets.
- **Model Building**: Define and compile a CNN model.
- **Model Training**: Train the model on the training data and monitor performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the validation data.
- **Conclusions and Next Steps**: Summarize findings and outline future improvements.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by Kaggle as part of the [G2Net Gravitational Wave Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection) competition. It includes training waveforms with corresponding labels indicating the presence of a gravitational wave signal.
